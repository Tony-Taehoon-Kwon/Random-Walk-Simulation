# Random-Walk-Simulation
The random walk simulation perform a dynamic analysis on random walk and attempt to visualize the simulation with several conditions. The purpose of this project is to see the trends of random walk with a variety of circumstances, to measure the number of steps and the probability, and to estimate how much is in line with what is expected.


There are three ways to run the application.

1. Installation (Easiest way)
- Open the folder [INSTALLER]
- Execute "Random Walk Simulation_Setup.exe"
- This way you can install the program and run it right away
- You can find the Uninstaller on the window start menu under "DigiPen" folder

2. Excute without installation (Fastest way)
- Open the folder [EXE (NO INSTALL)]
- Excute "MAT394_taehoon.kwon_RWS.exe"
- Make sure following files are in the same directory :
  [res] folder
  MAT394_taehoon.kwon_RWS.exe
  
3. Run program with Visual Studio 2019
- Open the folder [SOURCE]
- Excute "MAT394_taehoon.kwon_RWS.sln"
- You can change the configuration on the toolstrip (Debug -> Release)
- Hit F5 to run
- This way you can check the code
